# The Purpose of using Markdown syntax

## Markdown is used to style text on the web.  The following can be used for styling purposes:

####
1. It can be used for **bolding** characters
2. It can be used for _italicizing_ characters
3. It can also be used for references such as:
	* [Referincing Links such as Google](www.google.ca)
	* Referencing images ![Canada flag](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Flag_of_Canada_%28Pantone%29.svg/1200px-Flag_of_Canada_%28Pantone%29.svg.png)
	* and my favorite part: Blockquotes:  
	> "To be (a developer), or not to be.. That is the question"
